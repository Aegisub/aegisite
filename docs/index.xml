At the time of the start of the project, many other programs that supported the Advanced Substation Alpha format lacked (and in many cases, still lack; development on several competing programs have since been dropped for various reasons completely unrelated to Aegisub) many vital functions, or were too buggy and/or unreliable to be really useful.</description></item><item><title>Overview</title><link>https://aegisub.github.io/aegisite/docs/latest/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aegisub.github.io/aegisite/docs/latest/overview/</guid><description>This screenshot shows the Aegisub main window with everything open:
The two most important areas are the Subtitles Grid and Edit Box.
The grid shows all the subtitle lines in the file you&amp;rsquo;re working with. Lines are marked with different colours depending on their properties. For example, lines with green background are selected. Lines with blue background are marked as comments and won&amp;rsquo;t be shown on screen. Lines with a light yellow background are visible on the current video frame.</description></item><item><title>Highlights</title><link>https://aegisub.github.io/aegisite/docs/latest/highlights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aegisub.github.io/aegisite/docs/latest/highlights/</guid><description>Some highlights of Aegisub:

It is at present incomplete and no information in it can be taken for granted. We attempt to be accurate on every point, to a reasonable degree.
Aegisub is software under constant development. While it is a goal to provide up-to-date documentation there will almost always be cases where the actual functionality of the program has changed since this documentation was last updated.</description></item><item><title>Support Aegisub</title><link>https://aegisub.github.io/aegisite/docs/latest/support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aegisub.github.io/aegisite/docs/latest/support/</guid><description>Do you want to support Aegisub?

Karaoke effects? # See the Karaoke Templater tutorials.
Can I create DVD subtitles with Aegisub? # Not directly, but there&amp;rsquo;s a nifty program called MaestroSBT that can convert SSA to VOBSubs. It does have quite a bunch of restrictions on what tags and other things may be used, so reading its manual first is advised.</description></item><item><title>Tutorials</title><link>https://aegisub.github.io/aegisite/docs/latest/tutorials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aegisub.github.io/aegisite/docs/latest/tutorials/</guid><description>The following tutorials are available for Aegisub:
