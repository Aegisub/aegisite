                        <p>The Automation system in Aegisub has evolved from a very basic and hardly useful stand-alone system for creating basic karaoke effects into a very powerful extension mechanism. Here's a short account of its history, from the principal author of the systems.</p>

<h2 id="automation1reallyjustkaraokeeffector">Automation 1, really just Karaoke Effector</h2>

<p><span class="createlink">Effector screenshot.png</span></p>

<p>The <em>Karaoke Effector</em> program was originally created for making karaoke effects for a small translation project, that later died. It was written in Borland Delphi and used Lua 5.0 for scripting. This use of Lua is the primary reason I even call it &quot;Automation 1&quot; today. It basically allowed creating effects similar to what the <em>simple-k-replacer</em> script from Automation 3 does, but in a more complicated and not as usable way.</p>

<h2 id="automation2thepythonenginethatneverhappened">Automation 2, the Python engine that never happened</h2>

<p>Automation 2 was intended to be the scripting system in Aegisub, I drafted the specifications for it while Aegisub was still only in internal pre-alpha development. It was planned to use Python for scripting language and be quite flexible. It just proved to be an overall bad design (which on hindsight might have been a good thing) and it was never implemented. Instead I started looking into Lua again and drafting what became Automation 3.</p>

<p>I don't think there's much of any proof of the work on Automation 2 left now. The main thing to be said about it is that the current Automation 4 achieves everything Automation 2 was intended to be, and even more.</p>

<h2 id="automation3backtoluaandsomethingusable">Automation 3, back to Lua and something usable</h2>

<p>After the fiasco of Automation 2 and Python I went &quot;browsing languages&quot; again and ended up going back to Lua, and also went for a much less ambitious design. This proved to work and ended up as the Automation 3 system. Originally Automation 3 was also intended to be somewhat extensible and down the road support more than just the basic modification of subtitle lines, this is evident from the <em>kind=&quot;basic_ass&quot;</em> statement required in all Automation 3 scripts. Unfortunately the overall architecture of Automation 3 in the end didn't allow it to be extended either way, and the first rough ideas for Automation 4 started forming.</p>

<p>In the end Automation 3 did prove very successful though and has done a great job.</p>

<h2 id="automation4unlimitedfeatureworks">Automation 4, unlimited feature works?</h2>

<p><span class="createlink">Hello-auto4.png</span></p>

<p>As the flaws of Automation 3 started showing through the design of Automation 4 begun. Lots of people had been crying for other languages, especially Perl and Python, so support for multiple scripting languages went into the core design. The development of Automation 4 was much on and off, standing still for months at a time. Originally it was planned for Aegisub 1.09, then got pushed to 1.10 and then finally to 1.11, which then grew into Aegisub 2 because of the load of new features and major redesigns in that version, Automation 4 one of them.</p>

<p>In mid-May 2006 Automation 4/Lua was finally in a &quot;working&quot; state, if I am to trust the timestamp of <em>hello-auto4.png</em> but first now, more than a year later, it's really useful. A testament to my laziness.</p>
