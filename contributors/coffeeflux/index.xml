This release, the first stable in a decade, was designed to have minimal feature changes from 3.2.2. The goal was to just cut a release that builds on modern systems, which was itself more than enough work. Further releases will include actual features and more normal changelogs. The version is 3.4.0 to avoid conflicts with forks that tagged things under 3.3.x.
Moving forward, development will continue out of TypesettingTools/Aegisub.</description></item></channel></rss>
