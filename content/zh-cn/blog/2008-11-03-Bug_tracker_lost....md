Oops.

We lost the bug tracker, and the latest back-up of it is from 2008-09-17. The chances to restore any newer dataset are very slim.

The server the tracker was hosted on has been shut down, and we don't have a replacement yet. We're trying to find a solution for the hosting.

Until later notice, expect *bugs.aegisub.net* to time out.
