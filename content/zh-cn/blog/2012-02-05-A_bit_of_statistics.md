As you may know, we have an automatic update checker in Aegisub, you may have noticed it telling you about the 2.1.9 release yesterday.

When we check for updates, we also send a little bit of anonymous system information back, to get an idea of what kind of systems Aegisub is being used on. This allows us to make some basic statistics. Here's a few facts:

In the past 35 hours, about 20,000 checks for updates have been made, in other words, Aegisub gets started more than 550 times an hour, or 13,500 times a day, worldwide. Of course, this only counts those who have automatic update checking enabled.

Those 20,000 checks have originated from slightly under 10,000 unique IP addresses, so the users covered seem to start Aegisub about 1.5 times a day.

Of those 10,000 users covered (we'll assume one IP address is one user), just below 2000 are running 2.1.9 now. There are still about 7500 2.1.8 users checked in, while 325 users are still stuck on 2.1.7... if you are one of those please tell why so we can fix the problem you have with more recent versions!

9700 users are on some Windows version, just below 100 on Mac OS X, and just below 70 on a Linux system. Sorry, with less than 2% of users on non-Windows systems those simply won't get as much attention.

More than 6500 users are on Windows 7, that's pretty cool. 2200 on Windows XP, 600 on Vista, almost 350 on some version Aegisub doesn't recognise (it could be Windows 8 Developer Preview, or maybe Wine), and then there's a few on 2003 Server, and two lone Windows 2000 users.

A little more than 1/3 of the IP addresses have checked in with a US English language operating system. We use the operating system language to gauge what language people prefer using their software in: The language you install your OS in is most likely the language you prefer to use all software in.
Next is Spanish, with a little above 10% of the language count, then follows Russian and French. After that there is a steeper drop and follows is the "long tail", of which the top is Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, German, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Polish and Arabic (Saudi Arabia). The remaining languages all have less than 200 reports counted on them. If all Chinese languages were added together they would be on a fourth place, close behind Russian.

Lastly, if the last half million entries in the logs are counted, more than 165,000 unique IP addresses are seen, but then the time period covered (about 6 weeks) is probably too long for it to be reasonable to assume that one IP equals one user. However, it is likely that there are more than a hundred thousand Aegisub installations around the world. That's pretty good.
