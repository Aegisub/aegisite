Mostly just some assorted bug fixes, a new UI translation (Dutch), and updates to the Arabic and
Finnish translations. As usual the changelog can be found [here](/changelog/3.0.3/).

This release is the first one in a while to have an official Linux binary, since Debian still doesn't package any versions of wxWidgets released in the last two years. It's somewhat experimental, but should work on all relatively recent Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu 12.04 and Debian Wheezy being the oldest versions I've tested).
