Damn, it seems people started pirating Aegisub.

Though I wonder where the keys generated by that keygen should be entered... and what would they crack? And I'd love to know how they managed to compress Aegisub that much, it could really help our own distribution!

SPOILER: The site is probably fake, just making up torrents that don't exist, so I'll assume those numbers are fake too. The site also just links to a different website whose URLs look like they'd want you to sign up just to perform a search of their archive.
