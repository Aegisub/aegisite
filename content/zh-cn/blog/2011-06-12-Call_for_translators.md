Version 2.1.9 is still getting closer to being ready for release, although there's still some actual issues needing, at the very least, testing.

However, there are some user interface languages we had in 2.1.8 or earlier versions, where the translator has gone missing, or just hasn't responded to my mail.

- Catalan (Eduard)

- Farsi (Meysam)

- ~~Korean (unknown)~~

- ~~Polish (Adam)~~

- ~~Vietnamese (Hung NGUYEN, OnEsChi)~~

- ~~Chinese, both Traditional and Simplified (mkboy2)~~

If you are one of the people listed here I would appreciate if you could contact me. If you otherwise speak one of these languages well and want to help, I would also love to hear so.

For most languages, there are just 5 strings in the main program that need translation. The exception to this is Polish, which has several more new strings.

Someone calling himself "Ling√ºista" also created a European Spanish translation recently, but did not leave any contact information. I think many people would appreciate being able to choose between a European Spanish and a Latin American Spanish translation. If you can help with a European Spanish translation you can see the work done currently on [ticket 1220](http://devel.aegisub.org/ticket/1220) on our Trac.

If you are interested in the process of translating Aegisub you can find more information on the [Translations page](http://devel.aegisub.org/wiki/Translations) on our Trac wiki.

**Update:** The Korean, Polish, Vietnamese and Chinese translations have been updated now.
