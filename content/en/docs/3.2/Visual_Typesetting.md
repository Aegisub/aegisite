**A video tutorial for this feature is available at [the tutorials section]({{< relref "Tutorials" >}}).**

## Overview

![video_display](/img/3.2/video_display.png#center)

### Play

Play the video and, starting at the currently displayed frame. See
[Video#playingvideo]({{< relref "Video#playingvideo" >}}) for comments on playing video in Aegisub.

### Play line

Play the video starting at the first frame of the currently active line,
stopping at the end of the line.

### Video autoseek

Toggles automatic seeking of the video to the first frame of a line whenever
a new line is selected.

### Frame time and number

Displays the current frame number and the start time of the frame. If the
currently displayed frame is a keyframe, this box has a green background.

Note that it is normal for the "Set start of selected subtitles to
current video frame" (Ctrl-3) and "Set end of selected subtitles to current
video frame" (Ctrl-4) to set the time to something different than what is
displayed here, as setting times to exactly the frame's time tends to result
in rounding errors.

{{<todo>}}Is the main toolbar actually documented anywhere? {{</todo>}}

### Subs relative time

Displays the time to the start and end time of the active subtitle line.
This is mostly useful for override tags which take relative times, such as
[\\t]({{< relref "ASS_Tags#animatedtransform" >}}) and [\\fad]({{< relref "ASS_Tags#fade" >}}).

### Zoom

Displays and allows changing the current video zoom.

### Video position slider

Used to seek the video. Holding shift while dragging the thumb snaps to
keyframes. By default, left/right seek forward/backward one frame;
alt-left/right seek forward/backward 10 frames; shift-left/right seek
forward/backwards one keyframe. The slider can be focused without
accidentally seeking by right-clicking it or pressing Ctrl-Space. If the
slider already has focus, Ctrl-Space will return keyboard focus to the
control that last had it.

## Video context menu

You can right click to bring a context menu with other options:

![Visual_menu](/img/3.2/Visual_menu.png#center)

Save PNG snapshot
: Saves a PNG snapshot of the current frame to the path specified in
  the [options]({{< relref "options" >}}). This snapshot will be in the real video size, and
  WON'T be affected by zooming or aspect ratio overriding.

Copy image to clipboard
: Same as above, but copies the frame to the clipboard, instead of
  saving as a PNG. You can then paste it in any image editing software.

Save PNG snapshot (no subtitles)
: Same as the previous option, but subtitles won't be visible in the
  image.

Copy image to clipboard (no subtitles)
: Same as above, but copying to clipboard.

Copy coordinates to clipboard
: Copies the current mouse coordinates to clipboard, e.g. "230,152"

## Tool Descriptions

There are currently seven different visual typesetting tools: crosshair,
drag, rotate on z axis, rotate on xy axes, scale, rectangular clip and
vector clip.

### Crosshair

This is the standard mode. Hovering the mouse over the video will show the
script coordinates under the cursor, as well as a crosshair indicating the
exact point that you are looking at. Holding down shift will make it instead
show the distance from the bottom-right corner. Double clicking a point will
position the current line (using the [\\pos tag]({{< relref "ASS_Tags#setposition" >}})) on
that position.  If alt is held down while double-clicking, all other selected
lines will be shifted by the same distance as the active line, including lines
not visible on the current frame.

![Visual_crosshair](/img/3.2/Visual_crosshair.png#center)

### Drag

The drag tool has two modes. You can toggle between them by clicking the button
on the auxiliary visual typesetting bar.

![Visual_drag](/img/3.2/Visual_drag.png#center)

On the positioning mode, you can simply click-and-drag subtitles across the
video surface by dragging their anchor (the square). They will be positioned
where you release them with the [\\pos]({{< relref "ASS_Tags#setposition" >}}) command.

On the movement mode, there is another anchor, the end-of-movement anchor,
which is represented by a circle. There will be an arrow pointing from the
start-of-movement to the end-of-movement anchor. In order to set the times
where the movement will start or end, move the corresponding anchor on the time
where you want the subtitle to be at that anchor. For example, if you want
movement to start at 5000 milliseconds after the start of the line, seek the
video to 5000 milliseconds after the start of the line, and drag the start
anchor there. The same goes for the end-of-movement anchor.

If your line has an origin point specified, you will see a third anchor,
represented by a triangle, connected to the square anchor by a dotted line. You
can also drag this to affect the origin position. This same anchor will be
visible in the two rotation tools.

If shift is held down while dragging an anchor, the drag will be limited to
only altering the X or Y coordinate of the anchor (whichever would be changed
more).

Multiple anchors can be selected at once by holding down ctrl and clicking on
the anchors which you want to add or remove from the selection. All selected
anchors are moved when one is dragged.

Double-clicking on a spot with no anchors will move the active anchor to that
position, similarly to double-clicking in the crosshair tool. If alt is held
down, all other selected anchors are shifted relative to the active anchor.

### Rotate on Z axis

On this mode, you will see a circle centered around the subtitle's pivot
(either it's position, or the origin point, if defined). The circle is
surrounded by 6 arcs that help mark and measure angles.

![Visual_rotate_1](/img/3.2/Visual_rotate_1.png#center)

There are two functionalities in this mode. You can either drag the origin
point (the triangle at the center of the circle) to move it (and insert a
[\\org]({{< relref "ASS_Tags#rotationorigin" >}}) tag, if none exists), or you can click and
drag anywhere else to rotate the line.

You will notice that there is a line connecting the center of the circle to the
mouse cursor. When you click and drag, the subtitle line rotate following that
line, that is, you must rotate the cursor around the center to rotate the line.
Just release the mouse to finish positioning. You can also use the ctrl key to
limit the rotation to increments of 30 degrees.

If the origin is far from the center, you will see a little helper line
indicating where the center of the subtitles will be positioned as you rotate
it.

If multiple lines are selected, all selected lines are set to the new rotation
(and not rotated relative to each other as in the drag and crosshair tools).

![Visual_rotate_2](/img/3.2/Visual_rotate_2.png#center)

### Rotate on XY axes

This mode is somewhat similar to the previous mode, although there are a few
important differences. Since this rotates on the two screen axes, the rotation
is three-dimensional, and therefore harder to visualize.

In order to make this easier, there is a grid representing the plane in which
the subtitles lie, and you rotate that grid. There are also three arrows
pointing from the center, indicating the direction and orientation of the three
axes.

![Visual_rotate_xy](/img/3.2/Visual_rotate_xy.png#center)

To use this tool, simply hold the mouse button anywhere on the screen and move
it. As you move it left and right, it will rotate the line on the Y axis, and
as you move it up and down, it will rotate the line on the X axis.

If you hold down the shift key while rotating, the rotation will be limited to
only one of the two axes - whichever has the greatest movement. If you hold
down the ctrl key, rotation will happen in steps of 30 degrees.

If multiple lines are selected, all selected lines are set to the new rotation
(and not rotated relative to each other as in the drag and crosshair tools).

As with the Z rotation tool, you can also drag the origin anchor here.

### Scale

This is the simplest tool, and allows you to scale subtitles on the X and Y
axes. It will show one bar for each axis, showing not only the 100% size, but
also the current scale.

![Visual_scale](/img/3.2/Visual_scale.png#center)

To use this tool, simply hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse up and
down (to scale on the Y axis) or left and right (to scale on the X axis). You
can hold down the shift key to limit scaling to the axis where the biggest
change happened, and ctrl to limit it to increments of 25%.

### Rectangular clip

The rectangular clip tool allows you to clip the subtitles so that nothing
OUTSIDE an axis-aligned rectangle can be displayed (in essence, the
`\clip(x1,y1,x2,y2)` tag).

![Visual_clip](/img/3.2/Visual_clip.png#center)

There are two ways to use this tool. You can either click and grab one of the
four vertices of the rectangle, to resize an already-existing clip, or you can
click-and-drag in empty space to create a new rectangle from scratch. The areas
that will be invisible will be darkened.

### Vectorial clip

Similarly to the last tool, the vectorial clip tool allows you to draw an area,
so that nothing outside it will be rendered. The difference, however, is that
this area can have any arbitrary shape defined by a path of lines and bézier
curves.

![Visual_vector_clip](/img/3.2/Visual_vector_clip.png#center)

This mode has 8 sub-tools:

![Visual_vector_toolbar](/img/3.2/Visual_vector_toolbar.png#center)

1. Drag - Allows you to drag a control point
1. Insert line - Allows you to insert a straight line from the last point to
   the current mouse position by clicking the point.
1. Insert bézier bicubic curve - The same as above, but it instead inserts a
   bicubic curve. You can then use the two control points to adjust the shape
   of the curve.
1. Convert between line and curve - Click on a line segment or bicubic curve
   to convert it to the other type.
1. Split curve - Click on a line segment or bicubic curve to split it in
   two, at the marked point.
1. Remove point - Click on a point to delete it.
1. Freehand shape - Click and drag with the mouse over the video and move
   the mouse to draw a freehand shape composed of line segments. This shape
   will automatically be closed, with the last point connecting to the first.
1. Freehand smooth shape - Same as above, but the shape will be smoothed
   with bicubic curves.

As with the drag tool, multiple control points can be selected at one by
ctrl-clicking on the anchors to be added or removed from the selection. By
default all control points are selected; to deselect them all click on a
blank spot when in Drag mode. Multiple control points can be selected at once
by clicking and dragging in move mode to perform a box selection.
