This page describes the **inline variables** also known as **dollar variables**
available in Karaoke Templater.

## How to use inline variables

All inline variables start with a dollar-sign. They only work in template
lines, not in code lines. You can, however, use them in code blocks on template
lines.

Here is an example of how a template text using inline variables could look:

```plaintext
{\pos(**$x**,**$y**)\t(**$start**,**$end**,\bord0)}
```

The highlighted parts are the inline variables in the template.

When a template is applied, the first thing that happens is that all inline
variables are found and replaced with their value. E.g. in the above example
`$x` and `$y` are replaced with the X and Y coordinates of the syllable the
template is being applied to, and `$start` and `$end` are replaced by the start
and end times of the syllable.

Case does not matter for inline variables. `$start`, `$START` and `$StArT` all
work and give the same result.

### Limitations

Inline variables are not "intelligent": they do the same no matter where you
place them or use them and don't "know" what tag it's being used with. Not
every variable can be used with success in all places, and the meaning of some
are affected by usage of e.g. the
[retime]({{< relref "./Code_execution_environment#retime" >}})
function. In these cases, inline variables may not be appropriate and you need
to use code blocks.

Because inline variables have their values determined as the very first thing
when a template is applied you can't affect their values in any way.

Using inline variables is an easy way to get started with an effect, but for
many advanced effects they might not be the best choice.

All positioning and sizing inline variables (such as `$y`, `$right` and
`$width` are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, unlike the values in the
internal data structures which you can get in code blocks, which have sub-pixel
precision.

## Line and syllable variables

The inline variables exist in both "line" and "syllable" variants. The "line"
variants contain information about the entire line being processed, the
"syllable" variants contain information about the current syllable being
processed.

There are also "automatic" variants of most of the variables, there are either
the line or the syllable variant depending on what kind of template they are
used in. In pre-line templates the automatic inline variables refer to the line
variants, and everywhere else they refer to the syllable variants.

## The variables

The line variables that also exist as automatic variants all start with a
lowercase L ("ell") letter. The syllable variants start with the letter S.

#### Line variants

layer
: line layer

lstart, lend, ldur, lmid
: line start time, end time, duration and midway, all absolute times in milliseconds

style
: name of the line style

actor
: name of the line actor

margin_l, margin_r
: effective left and right margin (line if nonzero, otherwise style)

margin_v, margin_t, margin_b
: effective vertical, top and bottom margin, vertical and top is same

syln
: number of syllables on line

li
: line index (first physical line in file is 1)

lleft, lcenter, lright
: line left, horizontal center and right edges, taking margins and alignment into account, rounded to an integer value

ltop, lmiddle, lbottom
: line top, vertical middle and bottom edges, taking margins and alignment into account, rounded

lx, ly
: line x and y position suitable for a \\pos command when alignment is not overridden

lwidth, lheight
: line width and height in pixels, this is rounded and might not match exactly with the positioning variables

#### Syllable variants

sstart, send, smid
: syllable start, end and midway times relative to start of line, suitable for putting into \\t and \\move

sdur, skdur
: syllable duration in milliseconds and centiseconds

si
: syllable index from start of line

sleft, scenter, sright
: absolute left, horizontal center and right edges for syllable from left edge of screen, suitable directly for \\pos and \\move

sbottom, smiddle, stop
: absolute bottom, vertical middle and top edges for syllable from top edge of screen, suitable directly for \\pos and \\move, adjusted for furigana positioning if needed

sx, sy
: syllable absolute x and y position in default alignment, suitable for using directly in \\pos and \\move

swidth, sheight
: syllable width and height in pixelsthis is rounded and might not match exactly with the positioning variables

#### Automatic variants

start, end, mid
: start and and midway time for line/syllable; absolute for lines and relative for syllables

dur, kdur
: duration in milliseconds and centiseconds of line/syllable

i
: line or syllable index

left, center, right
: left, center and right edges of line/syllable, absolute from left screen edge

top, middle, bottom
: top middle and bottom edges of line/syllable, absolute from top screen edge

x, y
: x and y position of line/syllable when using default alignment

width, height
: width and height of line/syllable in pixels, this is rounded and might not match exactly with the positioning variables
