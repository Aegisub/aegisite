The Lua code in code blocks and on code lines is run in a separate global
environment such that it won't accidentally disturb the main script
function.

You can store your own data in this environment for use later, for example
pre-compute some values on code-lines and later insert them using code
blocks, but it also contains several pre-defined variables and functions
designed to make it easier writing effect templates.

It's important to understand that the contents of code execution
environment and the
[inline-variables]({{< relref "./Inline_variables" >}})
($-variables) are not related. You cannot change an inline-variable by
changing something in the code execution environment nor can you add new
ones. However, you can create and re-define the contents of the code
execution environment.

## Line and syllable information  ##
The code execution environment contains a few variables pointing to the
current line and syllable structure being processed, as well as some more
supporting tables. These are just references to the structures produced by
[karaskel]({{< relref "../Lua/Modules/karaskel.lua.md#datastructures" >}}) and are not
modified in any way.

You should treat all of these except `line` as read-only. If you change the
other ones, the kara-templater script might start misbehaving.

* **line** - The line currently being produced. Changing this will affect
  the resulting line in the file. See the **[reference for dialogue line tables]({{< relref "../Lua/Modules/karaskel.lua.md#dialoguelinetable" >}})**.
* **orgline** - The original line. This is the source line the current
  syllable is located on.
* **syl** - The current syllable structure. If the current template is a
  _furi_ template, it's the current furigana syllable. If the current
  template has one or both of the _char_ or _multi_ modifiers, this is a
  pseudo-syllable structure, a copy of the original syllable structure with
  several values changed to look like the current part of the syllable
  being processed. Also see the **[reference for syllable tables]({{< relref "../Lua/Modules/karaskel.lua.md#karaokeandfuriganasyllabletables" >}})**.
* **basesyl** - Usually the same as `syl`, except when the template has the
  _char_ or _multi_ modifier, then this is the original syllable. (If `syl
  == basesyl` is true, then the current template is neither _char_ nor
  _multi_.)
* **meta** - Contains various metadata about the script, namely the
  contents of the _Script Info_ section. Most importantly, it has the
  `res_x` and `res_y` fields describing the script resolution.

All of these variables are reset to `nil` whenever processing starts for a
new line, except `meta`. They are then set to the relevant value whenever
processing hits a new stage. This means that, for example _pre-line_
templates only has `line` and `orgline` set and both `syl` and `basesyl`
are `nil`. In _code once_ templates, all of the variables except `meta` are
`nil`.

## Standard libraries and related things  ##
Both the [**string**](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4) and
[**math**](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.6) Lua standard
libraries are imported into the execution environment, as they are
generally useful.

You can also access the main execution environment of the kara-templater
script itself using the **`_G`** (underscore capital-G) variable and
through that access the rest of the Lua standard library and any [loaded modules]({{< relref "../Lua/Modules" >}}). For example, `_G.table.sort` refers to
the regular `table.sort` function. See the [Lua 5.1
manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5) for details on the
available libraries.

For backwards compatibility, several of the included modules
([karaskel.lua]({{< relref "../Lua/Modules/karaskel.lua.md" >}}),
[unicode.lua]({{< relref "../Lua/Modules/unicode" >}}) and
[utils.lua]({{< relref "../Lua/Modules/util" >}})) are automatically loaded
and will be accessible via `_G` by default. All others must be explicitly
`require`d on a code line.

There is also the self-reference **`tenv`** variable which refers to the
code execution environment itself. This means that `tenv.tenv == tenv` is
true.

## Utility functions  ##
These functions help do more complex modifications of the output line (the
`line` variable) and are unavoidable when creating complex effects.

### retime  ###
Synopsis: `retime(mode, startadjust, endadjust)`

![Auto4-kara-templater-retime-explanation](/img/3.2/Auto4-kara-templater-retime-explanation.png)

This function is usually used once in a template in a code block by itself.
It adjusts the start and end time of the output line in various ways.

The _mode_ parameter determines how the start and end times of the line are
changed, it must be a string with one of the following values. Because it
must be a string, the name of the mode must be enclosed in quotation marks!

The _startadjust_ and _endadjust_ parameters slightly change meaning based
on the mode, but generally is a number of milliseconds added to the "base"
time controlled by the mode.

Possible _mode_s:

* **abs** or **set** - Both _startadjust_ and _endadjust_ are used as
  absolute time values to set the start and end time of the line directly.
* **preline** - Intended to make effects that happen before the actual line
  start. Both start and end time of the line are set to the start time of
  the line, then _startadjust_ is added to the start time and _endadjust_
  added to the end time. Usually _startadjust_ should be negative here and
  _endadjust_ be zero.
* **line** - Use the regular line timings and just add _startadjust_ to the
  start time and _endadjust_ to the end time.
* **start2syl** - Intended to make the look of the syllable from the start
  of the line until it is highlighted. The start time of the line is kept
  and the end time is set to the start time of the syllable. Use
  _startadjust_ and _endadjust_ to offset the times.
* **presyl** - Similar to _preline_ but for the syllable timing instead.
* **syl** - From start of syllable to end of syllable.
* **postsyl** - Similar to _presyl_ but the base timing is the syllable end
  time instead of start time. You will usually want to use a zero
  _addstart_ and positive _addend_ here.
* **syl2end** - The time from the end of the syllable to the end of line,
  similar to _start2syl_.
* **postline** - Similar to _postsyl_ but for the line timing instead.

There is also a special _mode_:

* **sylpct** - Both of _startadjust_ and _endadjust_ are treated as
  percentage values from 0 to 100 and are used to set the line timing to
  cover that part of the syllable's time.

Be careful with the `retime` function on _line_ templates. If you use it
directly on a _line_ template it will probably not do what you want. You
should only use it on _pre-line_, _syl_ and _furi_ templates. You should
also only use it once in each template.

The `retime` function always returns the empty string (`""`) which will
cause it to output nothing when used in code blocks, but still evaluate to
true if used in boolean expressions.

{{<example-box>}}
    template syl: !retime("preline", -1000, 0)!{\pos($scenter,$smiddle)\an5\fscx0\fscy0\t(\fscx100\fscy100)}

This creates a kind of "pop-in" effect for the syllables that lasts 1
second (1000 milliseconds) before the actual line timing. The two important
things to code: Quotation marks around `"preline"` and that the start
offset is negative, -1000, because the start time needs to be moved
backwards.
{{</example-box>}}
{{<example-box>}}
    template syl: !retime("syl", 0, 0)!{\pos($x,$y)\t(\fscx360)}

Makes the syllable spin around itself during its highlight. Unless you also
have _syl_ templates retimed to `start2syl` and `syl2end` the
syllable will only be visible during its highlight. Note how retiming a
syllable line to just the syllable time makes it unneeded to put start and
end times in the `\t` tag, as they default to the duration of the entire
line and here the duration of the line is the duration of the syllable.
{{</example-box>}}
{{<example-box>}}
    template syl: !retime("sylpct", 0, 50)!{\move($x,$y,$x,!$y-10!)}
    template syl: !retime("sylpct", 50, 100)!{\move($x,!$y-10!,$x,$y)}

These two templates together makes the syllable move 10 pixels upwards
during the first half of its highlight and back down during the last half.
Using `retime` is an easy way to get multiple `\move` tags to affect the
same syllable; there can only be one `\move` tag on one line, but if you
split the line into many "chained" times you can create an effect of the
same syllable moving in several directions.
{{</example-box>}}

### relayer  ###
Synopsis: `relayer(newlayer)`

Change the Layer field of the generated line to _newlayer_.

**Note:** If you want a template to always generate lines with a static
layer number, you do not need to use this function. You can just set the
Layer field on the template line, and it will transfer to the generated
lines. This function is only needed when the layer number is dynamic.

{{<example-box>}}
    template syl: !relayer(syl.i*5+20)!

Each syllable generated from the line gets a progressively higher layer
number. The first syllable gets in layer 25, the second in layer 30 and so
on, each syllable getting a layer 5 larger than the previous.
{{</example-box>}}

### restyle  ###
Synopsis: `restyle(newstyle)`

Change the Style field on the generated line to _newstyle_.

**_Be careful_** _that this does not update the sizing and positioning
information._ If you want to use sizing or positioning information such as
`$x`, `$lwidth`, `line.middle` and `syl.right` you must change to a style
that uses the same font name, font size, boldness, italics, font encoding,
X and Y scaling, character spacing, alignment and margins. If you change to
a style where any of those properties are different, the positioning and
sizing information will be invalid.

No example because the function has limited use.

### maxloop  ###
Synopsis: `maxloop(newmax)`

Dynamically control the number of times a template will be looped.

**_Be careful_** _that you do not make a template that loops forever._

You do not need to use the loop modifier on templates to use this function.

{{<example-box>}}
    template syl: !maxloop(syl.width + 2*line.styleref.outline)!{\clip(!line.left+syl.left-line.styleref.outline+j-1!,0,!line.left+syl.left-line.styleref.outline+j!,!meta.res_y!)\an5\move(!line.left+syl.center!,!line.middle!,!line.left+syl.center!,!line.middle+math.random(-20,20)!,$start,$end)\shad0}

Cut each syllable into a number of slivers, depending on the size of the
syllable. Each sliver moves randomly on highlight.
{{</example-box>}}
{{<example-box>}}
    template syl: !maxloop(j+1)!

Makes an infinite loop. It continually sets `j` one higher, making the loop
never complete.
{{</example-box>}}

### loopctl  ###
Synopsis: `loopctl(newj, newmaxj)`

Control both loop variables. This function has questionable utility.

_newj_ sets the new value of `tenv.j` and _newmaxj_ sets the new value of
`tenv.maxj`.

No example because the function has limited use.

### remember and recall ###
Synopsis:
* `remember(name, value)`
* `remember_if(name, value, condition)`
* `recall(name)`
* `recall(name, default)`

This suite of functions lets you calculate a value in one template and re-use
it in later templates. This is especially useful together with the
`math.random` function, since remember/recall will let you choose a random
value in one template and use the same random value in a later template for the
same syllable.

_name_ is a user-chosen name to identify the saved value. It should be a string,
so usually written as a string literal with quotes.

_value_ is the value to store. It can be any Lua value, although string and
number values are the most useful.

_default_ is a value to recall if nothing has been stored with the name yet.

_condition_ controls whether the value will actually get stored or not.

The `remember` and `remember_if` functions both return the given _value_
unchanged. This means you can put a `remember` call anywhere you would put
the bare value.

The `remember_if` function will only store the value if the given _condition_
is a truthy value (i.e. not `nil` or `false`.) It still returns the value even
if the condition is falsey.

{{<example-box>}}
    template syl: {\frz!remember("entryrotation",math.random(100,200))!\fscx300\fscy300\t(0,300,\frz0\fscx100\fscy100)\pos($x,$y)}
    template syl: {\frz-!recall("entryrotation")!\fscx300\fscy300\t(0,300,\frz0\fscx100\fscy100)\pos($x,$y)\fad(300,0)}

The first line chooses a random number between 100 and 200 degrees, and stores
the chosen value with the name `"entryrotation"`. It then uses that number to set
a rotation and transform it to 0, causing the syllable to rotate to its correct
position.

The second line loads the same number back, since it uses the name
`"entryrotation"` for recall. It places a minus sign in front of it, but
otherwise does the same effect. The result is two copies of the syllable
rotating opposite each other, but the same amount.
{{</example-box>}}
{{<example-box>}}
    template syl: {\fscx!remember_if("longsyllables", recall("longsyllables", 100)+10, #syl.duration>200)!}

Here `remember_if` and `recall` are combined, together with a default value,
to set up a value that updates itself every time it is used.

The name "longsyllables" is attempted recalled, innermost, but if it doesn't
exist yet the value 100 is used instead. Then 10 is added to it, and if the
syllable has a duration longer than 200 ms, the value (recalled + 10) gets
stored back.

The effect is that the `\fscx` gets 10 bigger for all syllables, every time
a "long" syllable is encountered.
{{</example-box>}}


## Template execution data  ##
These variables either give some further information on the status of the
executing template or modify the rules for template execution in some way.
They generally work together with specific template modifiers.

### Looping templates  ###
When a template with the _loop_ or _repeat_ modifier is running, two new
variables are introduced in the code execution environment, **`j`** and
**`maxj`**.

* **maxj** is the number of loops, i.e. simply the parameter given to the
  _loop_ modifier.
* **j** is the loop iteration counter. It starts at 1 in the first
  iteration and _maxj_ in the last.

If you change `j` or `maxj` while a template is executing, you can affect
the number of iterations the loop makes. The
[`maxloop`]({{< relref "Code_execution_environment#maxloop" >}})
function is convenient for making dynamic loops.

{{<example-box>}}
<code><pre>template syl loop 5: {\an5\pos($scenter,$smiddle)\1a&HFF&\3a&Hcc&\t($start,$end,\fscx!100+<u>j</u>\*10!\fscy!100+<u>j</u>\*10!\3a&HFF&)}</pre></code>

The syllable fill is hidden so only the border is visible, then several
copies of the that border-only line is made through the loop, and made to
"explode" to different, growing sizes using the `j` variable.

This example assumes that the style definition has shadow disabled but it
does have a border.
{{</example-box>}}

{{<example-box>}}
<code><pre>template syl loop 20: {\move($x,$y,!$x+15\*math.cos(math.pi\*2\*<u>j</u>/<u>maxj</u>)!,!$y+15\*math.sin(math.pi\*2\*<u>j</u>/<u>maxj</u>)!,$start,$end)\t($start,$end,\alpha&HFF&)}</code></pre>

Here looping is used to [calculate several points on a
circle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle#Trigonometric_functions_on_the_unit_circle)
with radius 15 and make the syllables move out to those. Just by changing
the number of loops in the Effect field you can make a more detailed circle
because `j/maxj` is used to calculate how large a portion of the total
number of loops have been completed.
{{</example-box>}}

### Conditional templates with fxgroup  ###
The _fxgroup_ modifier uses a special table **`fxgroup`** in the code
execution environment to control whether a template will be executed or
not.

The parameter given to the _fxgroup_ modifier names a key (always a string)
in the `fxgroup` table in the execution environment, and when a template
assigned to an fxgroup is about to be executed, the value for that key in
the `fxgroup` table is looked up. If the value is true or the key doesn't
exist, the template is executed, if it's false the template is skipped.

While you can technically use any text string for fxgroup names, because
they're used in Lua code it's best to avoid ones that overlap with Lua
reserved words such as `end`, `break`, `return` and several more.

{{<example-box>}}
<code><pre>code syl: <u>fxgroup.long = (syl.duration > 200)</u>
template syl noblank: all here:
template syl <u>fxgroup long</u>: is long:
karaoke: {\k10}huh? {\k40}wee~~</code></pre>

It's important to understand the template execution order to understand
this example. For each input syllable (i.e. "huh?" and "wee~~") all the
templates and code lines are run in the order they appear.

This means that for "huh?", first the code line is run. It determines that
the duration of that syllable is less than 200 ms and thus sets
_fxgroup.long_ to false. The first template has no fxgroup, so it's applied
to the syllable then, outputting a line "all here: huh?", but the second
template has fxgroup "long". This fxgroup was disabled for that syllable by
the code line, so that template is not run at all.

For "wee~~", the code line determines that its duration is longer than 200
ms, so the "long" fxgroup is enabled. Then the first template outputs its
line, "all here: wee~~", and when the second template is to run, its
fxgroup is enabled now so it's also run, outputting "is long: wee~~".

Neither of the two templates will output anything for the zeroth syllable.
The first template, because it has the "noblank" modifier, and the second
because the zero'th syllable's duration is too short for the fxgroup to be
enabled.
{{</example-box>}}

{::template name="automation_navbox" /}
