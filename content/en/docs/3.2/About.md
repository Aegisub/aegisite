Aegisub was originally created as a tool to make typesetting,
particularly in anime fansubs, a less painful experience. At the time
of the start of the project, many other programs that supported the
Advanced Substation Alpha format lacked (and in many cases, still lack;
development on several competing programs have since been dropped for
various reasons completely unrelated to Aegisub) many vital functions,
or were too buggy and/or unreliable to be really useful.

Since then, Aegisub has grown into a fully fledged, highly customizable
subtitle editor. It features a lot of convenient tools to help you with
timing, typesetting, editing and translating subtitles, as well as a
powerful [scripting environment]({{< relref "Automation" >}}) called Automation
(originally mostly intended for creating karaoke effects, Automation
can now be used much else, including creating macros and various other
convenient tools).
