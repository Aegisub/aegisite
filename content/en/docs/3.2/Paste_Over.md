The **paste over** tool is a "smart" variant of the good old `Ctrl`+`C` & `Ctrl`+`V`
combo. It allows you to paste any given field(s) of one or more lines to the
corresponding fields of other lines, without affecting the other fields. It can
be found under the _Edit_ menu -> _Paste lines over_, or by right-clicking on
the subtitles grid.

To use it, first copy one or more lines with the familiar copy function
(right-click -> copy, or `Ctrl`+`C`). Then select the line(s) you want to paste to,
and click _paste lines over_ (or press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`V`. You will then get a
dialog box that looks like this:

Tick the fields you want to paste (the buttons below the checkboxes can be used
to select all fields (in which case paste over is almost the same as normal
pasting except it replaces existing lines instead of inserting new ones), no
fields (in which case it does nothing), just the text field, or both time
fields) and press OK. The fields you selected will then be pasted. It's as
simple as that.

Do note that the paste over function isn't limited to using lines copied from
Aegisub itself; you are free to copy correctly formatted lines from any text
editor, chat program, web browser etc. etc.
