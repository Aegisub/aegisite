- Bugfix: The actor dropdown list didn't always work, it's hopefully fixed now (jfs)
- Automation: Yet another attempt at fixing the slowdown bug (jfs)
- Added option "Audio Draw Boundary Lines", if disabled, no vertical lines (except for current selection) are drawn on the audio waveform. Karaoke syllable boundaries are always drawn (jfs)

- SSA Mode: Committing changes now switches to next line and sets the selection to the part following the old selection (jfs)
- SSA Mode: Selecting another line in the grid no longer changes the audio selection (jfs)

- When loading video, if the video and subs resolution don't match, ask to change the subs resolution (jfs)
- New config option to control the above, "Video Check Script Res" (jfs), it can take the following values 
  - (0) Never change subs resolution to match video
  - (1) Ask to change subs resolution on mismatch
  - (2) Always change subs resolution on mismatch (never ask)
- New subs have default resolution 640x480 (to match most common videos) (jfs)
- New config option: "Audio Line boundaries Thickness" controls the thickness of the lines marking the start/end of the current selection (jfs)
- Bugfix: Loading audio files of different sample rates without closing the program resulted in audio playing too slow/fast (jfs)
- New color picker dialog (jfs)
  - Graphically pick colors from different colorspaces (RGB, PC-YUV, HSL, HSV)
  - Manually enter color values in those colorspaces
  - ASS and HTML hex input
  - 24 recently-used colors (automatically managed)
  - "Screen eyedropper" to make a screengrab and pick a color from that
- The following windows remember their last used position (not across program restarts, though) (jfs)
  - Styles Manager
  - Styling Assistant
  - Translation Assistant
- Most dialog windows now center on the window behind them (jfs)
- The start and end markers for audio selection can now have different colors, use the "Audio Line boundary start" and "Audio Line boundary end" options to change them, the old "Audio Line boundaries" option is no longer used (jfs)
- Blank script resolution will now be interpreted as 384x288 (VSFilter's default) if script res is blank (AMZ)
- Audio playing of selection will now play until new end time when it's changed during playback (AMZ)
- Aegisub will now display a proper error message if it attempts to load an outdated avisynth.dll, instead of just crashing (Myrsloik)
- Automation: Changed the result array from process_lines to use one-based indexes, instead of zero-based indexes, to follow Lua standards. Zero-based indexes still work. The input arrays are still zero-based. (jfs)
- Automation: Added new factorybrew script, line-per-syllable.lua. Allows you to make line-per-syllable karaoke effects by using variable substitution and calculation. Built off karaskel-adv.lua (jfs)
