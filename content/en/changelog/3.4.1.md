### Internationalization

- Rework Portuguese (Brazilian) translation
- Add Turkish translation
- Generate correctly desktop and metainfo files
- Ensure that the locale set is a UTF-8 one (this caused issues with non-ASCII searches)
- Fix locale-dependent paths breaking (this prevented Aegisub from loading files with non-ASCII paths)

### Packaging

- Generate tarballs with `git_version.h` and the LuaJIT subproject prepopulated
- Remove readonly/access denied test files
- Make version.sh work with GNU grep

### OS X

- Ungarble OS X icons
- Fix builds on Sequoia (note: this does NOT solve the packging problems mentioned in the 3.4.0 post, it just allows for local builds)

### Stuff

- Fix crash when using search/replace with multiple windows
- Don't allow opening dialogs twice
- Add and enable dav1d for AV1 decoding
- Fix error when loading the spell checker
