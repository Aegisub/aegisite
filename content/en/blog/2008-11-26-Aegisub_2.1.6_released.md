Ooooooooops.

Apparently the fix on 2.1.5 caused audio selection to become much slower. This release will hopefully fix all of those issues. Since this is a very minor change, you can download a RAR with only the new executable (plus its pdb) and extract it over the 2.1.5 install (typically "C:\\Program Files\\Aegisub"). The RAR "patch" is available [here](http://www.malakith.net/amz/aegisub/aegisub-r2494.rar). [\[Exias' mirror\]](http://mirror.exinet.co.uk/aegisub/aegisub-r2494.rar)

If you want to download the complete 2.1.6 installer, you can download it [here](http://www.malakith.net/amz/aegisub/aegisub-r2494-setup.exe). [\[Exias' mirror\]](http://mirror.exinet.co.uk/aegisub/aegisub-r2494-setup.exe)

Also, a cookie to the first one who can tell me what Hollywood movie is related to this particular version number. ;)
