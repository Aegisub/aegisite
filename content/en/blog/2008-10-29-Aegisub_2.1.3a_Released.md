Yes, it took a while, but here's a new release preview build. The biggest changes from 2.1.2 are:

- FFmpegSource2 is the new default audio and video provider, replacing Avisynth. This should provide frame-exact seeking (with keyframe support) on AVI, MKV and MP4 files, as well as other benefits. This is still a bit experimental, however. If you have any issues, just switch back to Avisynth in options.
- ~~The DirectSound audio player was reverted to what it was in 2.1.1, since 2.1.2 seems to have critical issues related to it.~~ *\[Edit: jfs says that the issue was after 2.1.2\]*
- Many small issues around the program were fixed.
- VSFilter has been updated to the MPC-HC 2.39 version, which includes jfs's new patches (see [this post](/blog/2008-07-24-vsfilter_hacks/))
- Aegisub is now built against Visual C++ 2008 SP1 runtimes. Hopefully there will be no issues related to this (ASSDraw is still built against 2005 SP1 runtimes, due to library issues). If you can't run Aegisub, try installing [this](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a5c84275-3b97-4ab7-a40d-3802b2af5fc2&displaylang=en) and reporting how it goes.

A listing of other fixes can be found on [TheFluff's builds page](http://www.mod16.org/hurfdurf/?page_id=19). This release includes the Brazilian Portuguese (100%), Catalan (99%) and Spanish (99%) translations. All other translations are too outdated, and were left out. If you are willing to update any of them, please let us know.

The download link to the installer is: <http://www.malakith.net/amz/aegisub/aegisub-r2429a-setup.exe>

As usual, feature requests and bug reports go in the [bug tracker](http://bugs.aegisub.net/). Please leave your feedback!

*Note: previous (non-a) release got nuked due to lack of Freetype2 support, which would cripple Fonts Collector.*
