Some time ago our [SVN](http://subversion.tigris.org/) server (source code management) stopped working. We aren't sure what went wrong, and since we haven't been able to reach the administrator of it we've had to move the repository to a new server.

Fortunately we have had access to full repository backups, so no data is lost. However we have had to re-create the user database, so if you had commit access before but don't have it now, please contact one of the project administrators.

The new SVN server is at <http://svn.aegisub.net/>.
