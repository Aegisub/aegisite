Due to a fairly serious bug introduced in 2.1.4, here's 2.1.5. Everyone is advised to update to it.

- Fixed a bug in audio display that caused it not to update properly (introduced on 2.1.4)
- Fixed a bug that caused Aegisub to crash if you attempted to load any ASS subtitles with malformed embedded fonts
- Tweaked the layout of the visual typesetting bar

The win32 binary is available [here](http://www.malakith.net/amz/aegisub/aegisub-r2481-setup.exe).

BTW, a good way to keep up with Aegisub updates it to subscribe to the [Atom feed](http://www.aegisub.net/feeds/posts/default) - I recommend [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com).
