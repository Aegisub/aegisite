Version 2.1.4 is now out for Windows. The highlights are:

- Hopefully removed the dependency on Visual C++ 2005 SP1 runtimes
- Greatly improved the draw speed of audio display (should make committing on spectrum mode much faster, depending on your settings) - please let me know if any instabilities are caused by this
- Fixed the aspect ratio of video when the audio display is too tall
- Added Hungarian translation
- Fixed a styling glitch in the fonts collector and translation assistant
- Made Aegisub capable of running if ffms2.dll isn't found

It can be downloaded [HERE](http://www.malakith.net/amz/aegisub/aegisub-r2455-setup.exe).
