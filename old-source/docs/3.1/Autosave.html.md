By default Aegisub automatically saves a backup copy of every subtitle file you
open, along with another copy every minute (if any changes have been made in
the last minute). These copies can be found in %APPDATA%\Aegisub\autosave on
Windows, ~/.aegisub/autosave on Linux, and ~/Library/Application
Support/Aegisub/autosave on OS X. In addition, they can be browsed directly
within Aegisub at File â†’ Open Autosaved File...

Aegisub automatically cleans up old files in the autosave directory, so the
automatic backups should not be used for long-term storage of files.
