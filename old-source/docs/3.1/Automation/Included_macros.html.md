Aegisub includes several macros. Here's a line-up of them.

## Apply karaoke template  ##
This is the macro incantation of Karaoke Templater. See the page on
[[Karaoke_Templater]] for how to use this.

This macro is only available when there is at least one template line in the
subtitle file.

## Make full-width  ##
Converts all ASCII characters to Japanese "full-width" variations of them.

This can be useful if you need to typeset a sign translation vertically,
such that the letters are "stacked".

This macro modifies all lines that are currently selected in the subtitles
grid.

{::template name="examplebox"}
Here's a typeset sign:

    {\fn@DFPGothic-EB\fs26\shad0\fe128\bord3\3c&H25485A&\c&HDEEBF1&\pos(456,184)\frz-90}Sign text

Notice that it uses an "@-font", a variation that exists of every CJK font
that has "fullwidth" characters rotated 90 degrees from the baseline.
Fullwidth characters include not just these fullwidth variations of the
Latin alphabet but also Japanese kana and kanji, hanzi, hanja and various
punctuation characters.

Now after running this macro on the line:

    {\fn@DFPGothic-EB\fs26\shad0\fe128\bord3\3c&H25485A&\c&HDEEBF1&\pos(456,184)\frz-90}Ｓｉｇｎ ｔｅｘｔ

This is what it looks before and after running the macro:

## Automatic karaoke lead-in  ##
Automatically join several karaoke-timed lines up timing-wise and add
appropriate `\k` tags in front of them.

This macro is designed to help creating karaoke effects, most importantly
creating transitions and lead-ins for lines. It's well suited for using when
the karaoke is timed but before applying effects, such as karaoke templates.

This macro requires at least two lines to be selected and it only works
sensibly if the start-time of each selected line is larger than the
start-time of the selected line that comes before it. It changes the timing
of the selected lines and adds `\k` tags at the start of them except the
first.

{::template name="examplebox"}
Here's two lines of "tightly" timed karaoke:

    Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.46,0:00:46.28,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\k15}Ne{\k14}ver {\k14}gon{\k13}na {\k37}give {\k40}you {\k49}up
    Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.57,0:00:48.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\k13}Ne{\k13}ver {\k13}gon{\k13}na {\k36}let {\k46}you {\k65}down

Both lines start exactly when the first word starts being sung, and they end
exactly when the last word ends.

Now if the _Automatic karaoke lead-in_ macro is run on these two lines, they
are changed into this:
<pre><code>Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.46,<u>0:00:46.28</u>,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,{\k15}Ne{\k14}ver {\k14}gon{\k13}na {\k37}give {\k40}you {\k49}up
Dialogue: 0,<u>0:00:46.28</u>,0:00:48.56,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,<u>{\k29}</u>{\k13}Ne{\k13}ver {\k13}gon{\k13}na {\k36}let {\k46}you {\k65}down
</code></pre>

The start-time of the second line is changed so it matches the end-time of
the first line, and a `\k` tag  is added to the start of the line, to make
up for the shift otherwise created by this. This effectively creates an
empty syllable that can be used as a "spacer" to create fade-in and fade-out
effects.

The macro also shows this message:

    Smallest inter-line duration: 290 milliseconds

This simply says that the smallest duration between two lines it found, was
290 milliseconds, or 0.29 seconds, so that's as much time you have to make
fade-in, fade-out and other transition effects, if you want every
syllable-highlight to be fully visible.

## Clean tags  ##
This macro does various cleaning up on the override tags in all selected
lines.

* Combines adjacent override blocks (i.e { ... }) except if both of the
  block contains \k tags each then they will be left as is
* Push any \k tags in override blocks to the front (e.g. from {\frz90\k40}
  to {\k40\frz90}). Special care will be taken for multiple \k tags within
  one block to preserve the ordering
* Move line-wide tags (i.e. tags whose effects affect the whole line -- \a
  \an \org \pos \move \fade \fad) to the beginning of the lines
* Remove all but first line-wide tags of the same class (note: \pos and
  \move are from the same class -- only first of them works in a line,
  therefore the script will find the first \move or \pos and retain whic of
  the two comes first and remove others. The same are done for \fad and
  \fade)
* Remove spaces in comma-separated parameters (e.g. \pos(200 , 200) becomes
  \pos(200,200))

This macro is also available as an export filter.

The main intended function of this macro is to make
[[karaskel.lua|Automation/Lua/Modules/karaskel.lua]] split karaoke lines more
sensibly into syllable structures, see the example.

This macro modifies all selected lines in the grid, re-writing all tag
blocks in them.

{::template name="examplebox"}
Original line:

    {\r\frz90\k80}Test {\r\fry180\k60}me

Karaskel creates these syllable structures:


* 0 = {\r\frz90}
* 1 = Test {\r\fry180}
* 2 = me

After running _Clean Tags_ on the line:

    {\k80\r\frz90}Test {\k60\r\fry180}me

Now karaskel creates these syllable structures:


* 0 = 
* 1 = {\r\frz90}Test
* 2 = {\r\fry180}me

The cleaned up version is generally what you'd want since it places the
override tags inside the syllables they affect.

## Add Edgeblur ##
Add [[`\be1`|ASS_Tags#bluredges]] to all selected lines. Lightly blurring the
edges of all dialogue lines can noticeably improve compressibility when
[[hardsubbing|Attaching_subtitles_to_video]] (especially when using older
codecs such as XviD), but edgeblur cannot be set in the style due to format
limitations.

## Strip tags ##
Remove all ASS override blocks and the tags within from the selected lines.

## Select Overlaps ##
Select all lines which begin while another line is still active. This can be
useful for catching timing errors, or for setting an alternate style for these
lines, which improves readability.
