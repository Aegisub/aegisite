The Styling assistant is a powerful tool for subtitles that have multiple
styles, such as cases when several actors have their own style, or for some
other reason you have many different styles for dialog lines.

## Overview  ##

As seen from the image above, the assistant is composed of the following:

* Current line field 
* Styles available field 
* Set style window 
* Keys field 
* Seek video to line start time checkbox
* Play audio button
* Play video button

The Current line field displays the line in the subtitles for which the
style will be set. The text in it cannot be edited.

Styles available field displays the styles available in the script. The
styles have to be imported through the Styles Manager or created with its
help. The styles can then be set for the selected line in the subtitles by
clicking on the desired style.

The set style window is the main aspect of the Styling Assistant. Through
it, styles can be applied to the line in the subtitles easily and without
much work. It support autocomplete, so it helps to select the desired
style after some characters are written in the window.

The Keys fields displays the keyboard shortcuts that are used for work with
the assistant.

If the Seek video to line start time checkbox is checked and video is
loaded, the video will seek to the beginning of each line which is
displayed for styling.

The play audio and video buttons play the audio or video for the current
line, to aid in determining what character is saying the line.

## The autocomplete function  ##

This window displays how the autocomplete function works. The characters
that were typed are on the white background and the rest of the name is
displayed as being selected. The selected part is what autocomplete sets as
the style that matches with the typed characters.

This image shows the response to a name that doesn't exist. The background
of the window is colored red to show that no style on the list of selected
styles matches the entered text.


## How to use  ##
Usage is simple. Select the first line you want to style and open the
assistant. Then you look at text, video and/or audio to determine who is
speaking it and type first few letters of style name, after which
autocomplete should kick in. Hit enter to go to next line and proceed until
you're finished. The other way is to double click on a style in the Styles
available list and the style will be applied to the selected line.
