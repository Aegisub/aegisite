Feel like really helping out, or do you just have some code you want to
donate? Some advice from readme.txt in the source tree:

First, some of the code is pretty readable, some is decent, and some is
patched up crap. Good luck. ;)

Before coding up a new feature you should probably hop on IRC and check
with a developer to verify that we agree it's a feature that Aegisub
should have, or you run the risk of wasting some work. Unsolicited bug
fixes are usually welcome, though.

Second, if you want to code anything for Aegisub, you will need to
agree to these terms:

1.  You will release the patch to the public domain or give its
    copyright to one of the developers. This is to stop a source file from
    being owned by too many people. (Exception: MAJOR changes might be
    accepted under BSD license under your name. Consult the developers)
1.  Make SURE it compiles and works fine before submitting to developers.
1.  Patches should normally be against git master, unless it's for a bug
    present in stable but not master.
1.  Pull requests should be rebased onto git master (or stable, if
    applicable), and you should have a topic branch per pull request.
    Please don't have any merge commits in your history.
1.  Aegisub doesn't have a single cohesive coding style, but do try to
    follow a style that's already present somewhere in the program (and
    preferable that of the code you're touching).

Third, this is all available under the BSD license. According to GNU
itself, BSD is GPL-compatible, meaning that you can link GPL code to
BSD code. Keep in mind, though, that if a source file has mixed BSD and
GPL content, it becomes ruled by GPL.
