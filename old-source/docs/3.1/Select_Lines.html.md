The **select lines** tool is useful for finding and selecting all lines in the
script that matches certain criteria. This can be useful from a number of
things ranging from deleting all comment lines to finding all lines said by a
certain actor. The tool can be found in the _Subtitles_ menu -> _Select lines_.

### Match ###
These controls what criteria will be used for selecting the lines.

Match
: Select all lines that match the criteria.

Doesn't match
: Select all lines that *don't* match the criteria.

Match case
: Controls case sensitivity, i.e. if the tool should care about the difference
between lower and upper case or not.

Exact match
: Matches the lines that matches the given string _exactly_.

Contains
: Matches the lines that _contains_ the given string.

Regular Expression match
: Treats the string as a [regular
expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) or "regex", and
matches if said expression matches. For a regular expressions tutorial, try
reading the [perlretut manual page](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html) or
googling. For a reference of the exact syntax supported by Aegisub, see the
[wxWidgets regular expressions reference
page](http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/stable/wx_wxresyn.html).

### Match dialogues/comments ###
Here you can choose if you want to select from comment lines, dialogue lines,
or both.

### Action ###
Decides what the tool should do with the lines that matches the given criteria.
You can choose between:

Set selection
: Your current selection will be discarded and all lines in the script matching
the criteria will be selected instead.

Add to selection
: Adds all lines in the script that matches the criteria to your current
selection.

Subtract from selection
: Deselects all currently selected lines that match the criteria.

Intersect with selection
: Does the inverse of subtract from selection. That is to say, all lines in the
current selection that matches the criteria are kept selected, but everything
else is deselected.
