{::options toc_levels="2" /}

The following is a list of every tag supported by the Advanced Substation
Alpha format. This is basically a detailed version of ass-quickref.txt. See
the [[tutorial|Typesetting_Tutorial]] for an introduction to typesetting,
using some basic tags.

## Special characters ##

The following tags are written in the middle of the text, and not inside
override blocks (i.e. not between { and }).

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Soft line break" id="\n"}\n{:/}
Insert a forced line break, but only when in wrapping mode 2. (See
[[the \q tag|ASS_Tags#wrapstyle]]). Note that this is a lowercase n.

In all other wrapping modes, this is replaced by a regular space. This is
rarely (if ever) actually useful. If you're not sure whether you want this or
\N, you probably want \N.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Hard line break" id="\N"}\N{:/}
Insert a forced line break, regardless of wrapping mode. Note that this is an
uppercase N.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Hard space" id="\h"}\h{:/}
Insert a non-breaking "hard" space. The line will never break automatically
right before or after a hard space, and hard spaces are not folded when they
appear at the start or end of a displayed line.

## Override tags ##
Override tags must appear within override blocks, which begin with { and end
with }. Any unrecognized text within override blocks is silently ignored, so
they are also commonly used for inline comments. Mixing comments and override
tags in the same override block is not recommended.

Tags fall into two general categories: those which set a property of the line
itself, and those which modifiy only the text following them. `\pos`, `\move`,
`\clip`, `\iclip`, `\org`, `\fade` and `\fad` are those in the first category;
all others are in the second. Tags in the first category should appear at most
once in a line, and where in the line they appear is unimportant. In addition,
some of them are mutally exclusive: `\pos` and `\move`; `\clip` and `\iclip`;
`\fad` and `\fade`. The result of inluding multiple instances of these tags or
mutally exclusive tags will vary between renderers and is not recommended.

Tags in the second category modify all text after the tag until the end of the
line or until the property is re-overridden by another tag.

Override tags always follow the same form: They start with a backslash \
character, then a name, and after the name the parameter to the tag. If the
parameter is omitted, the default value from the line's style is used.

Some tags are "complex" and take more than one parameter. In these cases,
parameters are put inside parentheses with commas between the parameters.

**Note on typography:**  
On this page, everything written in _italics_ with `<` angle brackets `>`
around it is a parameter and you must enter a value instead of it. The angle
brackets are not part of the value you should enter. Use the examples as a
guide to how the tags should be entered. In general, the same rules apply to
all tags in how they look.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Italics" id="\i"}\i1<br>\i0{:/}
Switch _italics_ text on or off. Use `\i1` to enable italics for the following
text and `\i0` to disable italics again.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Bold" id="\b"}
\b1  
\b0  
\b<i>&lt;weight&gt;</i>
{:/}
Switch **boldface** text on or off. Use `\b1` to enable boldface for the
following text and `\b0` to disable boldface again.

The <code>\b<i>&lt;weight&gt;</i></code> form allows you to specify an
explicit weight to use. Note that most fonts only support one or two weights
so you rarely need to use this. Font weights are multiples of 100, such that
100 is the lowest, 400 is "normal", 700 is "bold" and 900 is the heaviest.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>I am {\b1}not[\b0} amused.</pre>

The word "not" is written in boldface.
{:/}

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>{\b100}How {\b300}bold {\b500}can {\b700}you {\b900}get?</pre>

The words are written with increasingly greater weight. Note that most fonts
do not have more than one or two different weights and you will only be able
to see "not bold" and "bold" in that case.
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Underline" id="\u"}\u1<br>\u0{:/}
Switch <u>underlined</u> text on or off. Use `\u1` to enable underlining for
the following text and `\u0` to disable underlining again.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Strikeout" id="\s"}\s1<br>\s0{:/}
Switch <s>striked out</s> text on or off. Use `\s1` to enable strikeout for
the following text and `\s0` to disable strikeout again.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Border size" id="\bord"}\bord<i>&lt;size&gt;</i>{:/}
Change the width of the border around the text. Set the size to 0 (zero) to
disable the border entirely.

If "scale border and shadow" (see [[script properties|Properties]]) is
enabled, the value is given in script resolution pixels, otherwise it is given
in video resolution pixels (which means the border thickness will vary
depending on the resolution of the video on which the subtitles are rendered.)

The value is not limited to whole integer pixels and can have decimal places.
Border width cannot be negative.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\bord0</pre>

Disable border entirely.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>bord3.7</pre>

Set the border width to 3.7 pixels
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Border size (extended)" id="\xbord"}
\xbord<i>&lt;size&gt;</i>  
\ybord<i>&lt;size&gt;</i>
{:/}
Use the `\xbord` `\ybord` tags to set the border size in X and Y direction
separately. This can be useful for correcting the border size for anamorphic
rendering of subtitles.

Note that if you use `\bord` after `\xbord` or `\ybord` on a line, it will
override both of them.

You can set the border width to 0 (zero) in one of the directions to entirely
disable border in that direction.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Shadow distance" id="\shad"}\shad<i>&lt;depth&gt;</i>{:/}
Set the distance from the text to position the shadow. Set the depth to 0
(zero) to disable shadow entirely. Works similar to [[\bord|ASS_Tags#bordersize]].

The shadow distance can not be negative with this tag.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Shadow distance (extended)" id="\xshad"}
\xshad<i>&lt;depth&gt;</i>  
\yshad<i>&lt;depth&gt;</i>
{:/}
Set the distance from the text to position the shadow at, with X and Y
position set separately. Shadow is only disabled if both X and Y distance is
0.

Note that unlike \shad, you can set the distance negative with these tags to
position the shadow to the top or left of the text.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Blur edges" id="\be"}
\be0  
\be1  
\be<i>&lt;strength&gt;</i>
{:/}
Enable or disable a subtle softening-effect for the edges of the text. The
effect isn't always very visible, but it can in some cases make the text look
better. It is usually more visible at smaller text sizes.

Be aware that this tag blurs the _edges_ of the text, not everything. This
means that if the text has a border (set with [[\bord|ASS_Tags#borderwidth]]) the
border will be blurred, but if there is no border, the main text will be
blurred instead.

In the extended version, _strength_ is the number of times to apply the
regular effect. Note that at high values the effect de-generates into
nothingness, and generally isn't very useful. For strong blurs, `\blur` is
generally more useful as a result. The _strength_ must be an integer number.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Blur edges (Gaussian kernel)" id="\blur"}\blur<i>&lt;strength&gt;</i>{:/}
In general, this has the same function as the [[`\be`|ASS_Tags#bluredges]] tag, but
uses a more advanced algorithm that looks better at high strengths. Unlike
`\be`, the _strength_ can be non-integer here. Set _strength_ to 0 (zero) to
disable the effect. Be careful, setting _strength_ too high can take a lot of
CPU time to render.

Be aware that this tag blurs the _edges_ of the text, not everything. This
means that if the text has a border (set with [[`\bord`|ASS_Tags#borderwidth]]) the
border will be blurred, but if there is no border, the main text will be
blurred instead.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Font name" id="\fn"}\fn<i>&lt;name&gt;</i>{:/}
Set the font face to use for the following text. There should be no space
between `\fn` and the font name, and you should not put parentheses or similar
around the font name either.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fnArial</pre>

The text following this tag will be in Arial font.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fnTimes New Roman</pre>

The text following this tag will be in Times New Roman font.
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Font size" id="\fs"}\fs<i>&lt;size&gt;</i>{:/}
Set the size of the font. The size specified is the height in script pixels,
so at font size 40 one line of text is 40 pixels tall. (Technical note: it's
really typographic (desktop publishing) points, not script pixels, but since
the rendering is always done at 72 DPI (as per the de facto standard), one
point ends up being exactly equal to one script resolution pixel.)

You can only specify integer font sizes.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fs10</pre>

The following text will use a size 10 font.
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Font scale" id="\fscx"}
\fscx<i>&lt;scale&gt;</i>  
\fscy<i>&lt;scale&gt;</i>
{:/}
Adjust the size of the text in X (`\fscx` or Y (`\fscy`) direction. The
_scale_ given is in percent, so 100 means "original size".

This is not the same as setting the font size, as setting the size is subject
to [font hinting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting) while scaling the
text modifies the text shape after hinting. As a result, this should always be
used with `\t` rather than `\fs`, as animating changing font hinting is very
rarely desirable.

These tags also affect [[vector drawings|ASS_Tags#drawing-commands]].

You can use font scaling to correct for anamorphic rendering and to specify
text size more precisely than with [[\fs|ASS_Tags#fontsize]].

Note that older versions of VSFitler will truncate non-integer scales.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fscx150</pre>

Make the text 50% wider than normal.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fscy50</pre>

Make the text half height.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fscx200\fscy200</pre>

Make the text double size.
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Letter spacing" id="\fsp"}\fsp<i>&lt;spacing&gt;</i>{:/}
Changes the spacing between the individual letters in the text. You can use
this to spread the text more out visually. The _spacing_ is given in script
resolution pixels.

Spacing can be negative and can have decimals.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Text rotation" id="\frx"}
\frx<i>&lt;amount&gt;</i>  
\fry<i>&lt;amount&gt;</i>  
\frz<i>&lt;amount&gt;</i>  
\fr<i>&lt;amount&gt;</i>
{:/}
Rotates the text along the X, Y or Z axis. The `\fr` tag is a shortcut for `\frz`.


* The **X axis** runs horizontally on the screen. Rotating on it (with
  positive values) causes an effect where the top of the text moves farther
  "into" the screen while the bottom moves "out" of the screen.
* The **Y axis** runs vertically on the screen. Rotating on it (with positive
  values) causes the text to rotate so that the left moves "outside" the
  screen, when the right moves "into" the screen.
* The **Z axis** runs perpendicular to the screen. Rotating on it (with
  positive values) causes the text to rotate in 2D, counterclockwise (as
  standard for degrees).

The rotation _amount_ is given in mathematical degrees, such that 360 degrees
is a full rotation, and rotating any multiple of 360 is the same as not
rotating. It is legal to specify negative rotation amounts, as well as amounts
larger than 360 degrees.

The rotation is performed around the subtitle line origin point, this is
described with the [[\org|ASS_Tags#rotationorigin]] tag.

These tags also affect [[vector drawings|ASS_Tags#vectordrawings]].

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\frx45</pre>

Rotate the text 45 degrees on the X axis.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fry-45</pre>

Rotate the text 45 degrees in opposite direction on the Y axis.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\frz180</pre>

Rotate the text 180 degrees on the Z axis, making it upside-down.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
The following two rotations produce the same result:
<pre>\frz-30
\frz330</pre>

This is because 330 degrees is 30 degrees less than a full rotation of 360 degrees.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\t(\frz3600)</pre>

Perform an animation where the text performs 10 full revolutions on the Z axis. Also see the [[\t|ASS_Tags#animatedtransform]] tag.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
The following screenshots illustrate the effect of rotating on the different axes:

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Text shearing" id="\fax"}
\fax<i>&lt;factor&gt;</i>  
\fay<i>&lt;factor&gt;</i>
{:/}
Perform a shearing (perspective distortion) transformation of the text. A
_factor_ of 0 (zero) means no distortion.

Usually _factor_ will be a small number; values outside the range -2 to 2 are
unlikely to have desireable results.

Shearing is performed after rotation, on the rotated coordinates. The
coordinate system used for shearing is not affected by the [[rotation
origin|ASS_Tags#rotationorigin]].

{::template name="examplebox"}
[[img/shearing.png]]
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Font encoding" id="\fe"}\fe<i>&lt;id&gt;</i>{:/}
Set the Windows font encoding used to select the font mapping table used to
translate Unicode codepoints to glyph indices in the font. For some fonts
without a Unicode mapping table this might be required to get text in certain
languages to work. For fonts that do have a Unicode mapping table, it might be
used to pick regional variations, such as picking the correct glyph for a Han
ideogram that is different in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
Japanese and Korean.

Some common font encoding IDs are:

* 0 - ANSI, Windows CP-1252 for Western-European languages.
* 1 - Default, depends on the configuration of the user's system, but also
  allows the font sub-system to dynamically pick a different mapping table in
  some circumstances.
* 2 - Symbol, codepoints in the 0-255 range are translated to per-font defined
  symbol glyphs, this is used for fonts such as Wingdings.
* 128 - Shift-JIS, used for Japanese.
* 129 and 130, respectively Hangeul and Johab, two encoding schemes for Korean.
* 134 - GB2312, used for Simplified Chinese.
* 136 - BIG5, used for Traditional Chinese.
* 162 - Turkish.
* 163 - Vietnamese.
* 177 - Hebrew.
* 178 - Arabic.

{::template name="todo"}Is that really correct?{:/}

A more complete list can be seen the [[style editor|Styles#thestyleeditor]]
dialog box.

In ASS files stored in non-Unicode encodings, this tag also affects what
codepage the text following it should be interpreted in. Aegisub doesn't
support this use and some renderers might not support it either. It is
recommended you do not rely on this and instead always store your files in a
Unicode encoding. (Aegisub stores files in Unicode UTF-8 by default.)

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Set color" id="\c"}
\c&H<i>&lt;bb&gt;&lt;gg&gt;&lt;rr&gt;</i>&  
\1c&H<i>&lt;bb&gt;&lt;gg&gt;&lt;rr&gt;</i>&  
\2c&H<i>&lt;bb&gt;&lt;gg&gt;&lt;rr&gt;</i>&  
\3c&H<i>&lt;bb&gt;&lt;gg&gt;&lt;rr&gt;</i>&  
\4c&H<i>&lt;bb&gt;&lt;gg&gt;&lt;rr&gt;</i>&
{:/}
Set the color of the following text. The `\c` tag is an abbreviation of `\1c`.

* `\1c` sets the primary fill color.
* `\2c` sets the secondary fill color. This is only used for pre-highlight in
  standard karaoke.
* `\3c` sets the border color.
* `\4c` sets the shadow color.

The color codes are given in
[hexadecimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) in Blue Green Red
order. Note that this is the opposite order of HTML color codes. Color codes
must always start with `&H` and end with `&`.

The Pick Color toolbar buttons [[img/pick-color-toolbar-buttons.png]] can
assist in picking colors and entering the color codes.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Set alpha" id="\alpha"}
\alpha&H<i>&lt;aa&gt;</i>  
\1a&H<i>&lt;aa&gt;</i>  
\2a&H<i>&lt;aa&gt;</i>  
\3a&H<i>&lt;aa&gt;</i>  
\4a&H<i>&lt;aa&gt;</i>
{:/}
Set the alpha (transparency) of the text.


* `\alpha` sets the alpha of all components at once.
* `\1a` sets the primary fill alpha.
* `\2a` sets the secondary fill alpha. This is only used for pre-highlight in
  standard karaoke.
* `\3a` sets the border alpha.
* `\4a` sets the shadow alpha.

An alpha of 00 (zero) means opaque/fully visible, and an alpha of FF (ie. 255
in decimal) is fully transparent/invisible.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\alpha&H80&</pre>

Set the alpha of all components to hexadecimal 80, decimal 128, making the
text 50% transparent in general.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\1a&HFF&</pre>

Set the primary fill alpha to hexadecimal FF, decimal 255, making it invisible
and effectively leaving only the border and shadow.
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Line alignment" id="\an"}\an<i>&lt;pos&gt;</i>{:/}
Specify the alignment of the line. The alignment specifies the position of the
line when no [[position override|ASS_Tags#setposition]] or
[[movement|ASS_Tags#movement]] is in effect, and otherwise specifies the
anchor point of positioning and rotation.

The `\an` tag uses "numpad" values for the _pos_, ie. the alignment values
correspond to the positions of the digits on the numeric keypad on a regular
keyboard:

1. Bottom left
2. Bottom center
3. Bottom right
4. Middle left
5. Middle center
6. Middle right
7. Top left
8. Top center
9. Top right

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Line alignment (legacy)" id="\a"}\a<i>&lt;pos&gt;</i>{:/}
Specify the alignment of the line using legacy alignment codes from SubStation
Alpha. This tag is supported but considered deprecated; you should usually use
`\an` in new scripts instead, as it is more intuitive.

The exception is that `\a6` should be used for lazy sign translating, because
if you're going to be lazy you should do it right and save the extra character.

Calculate _pos_ as follows: Use 1 for left-alignment, 2 for center alignment
and 3 for right-alignment. If you want sub-titles you're done. To get
top-titles, add 4 to the number, to get mid-titles add 8 to the number:

* 1: Bottom left
* 2: Bottom center
* 3: Bottom right
* 5: Top left
* 6: Top center
* 7: Top right
* 9: Middle left
* 10: Middle center
* 11: Middle right

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Karaoke effect" id="\k"}
\k<i>&lt;duration&gt;</i>  
\K<i>&lt;duration&gt;</i>  
\kf<i>&lt;duration&gt;</i>  
\ko<i>&lt;duration&gt;</i>
{:/}
> _Please note that these tags alone only create some very specific effects
> and all other effects are created with a combination of multiple different
> tags._

The `\k` family of tags mark up subtitles for karaoke effects by specifying
the duration of each syllable. You place a `\k` tag before each syllable in
the line.

The _duration_ is given in centiseconds, ie. a _duration_ of 100 is equivalent
to 1 second. You generally don't enter `\k` tags manually but rather use
karaoke timing tools such as [[Aegisub's karaoke
mode|Tutorials#karaoketiming]].

The different `\k` tags create various effects:

* `\k`: Before highlight, the syllable is filled with the secondary color and
  alpha. When the syllable starts, the fill is instantly changed to use
  primary color and alpha.
* `\K` and `\kf`: These two are identical. Note that `\K` is an uppercase K
  and is different from lowercase `\k`. The syllable fill starts out secondary
  color, when the syllable starts, the fill changes from secondary to primary
  with a sweep from left to right, so the sweep ends when the syllable time is
  over.
* `\ko`: Similar to `\k`, except that before highlight, the border/outline of
  the syllable is removed, and appears instantly when the syllable starts.

_Note: There is an additional karaoke tag, `\kt`, which is very different from
the other ones. It is rarely useful and Aegisub does not support that tag, so
it is not documented._

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Wrap style" id="\q"}\q<i>&lt;style&gt;</i>{:/}
Determine how line breaking is applied to the subtitle line. The following
_style_s are available:

* 0: Smart wrapping, make each line approximately equally long, but top line
  wider when equal width is impossible. Only `\N` forces line breaks.
* 1: End-of-line wrapping, fill as much text in a line as possible, then break
  to next line. Only `\N` forces line breaks.
* 2: No word wrapping, wide lines will extend beyound the edges of the screen.
  Both `\n` and `\N` force line breaks.
* 3: Smart wrapping, similar to style 0, but bottom lines are made wider.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Reset style" id="\r"}\r<br>\r<i>&lt;style&gt;</i>{:/}
Reset the style. This cancels all style overrides in effect, including
[[animations|ASS_Tags#animatedtransform]], for all following text.

The first form that does not specify a _style_ will reset to the style defined
for the entire line, while the second form, that specifies the name of a
_style_, will reset the style to that specific style.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>-Hey\N{\rAlternate}-Huh?\N{\r}-Who are you?</pre>

Assuming the current line style is "Default", this has first "Hey" in the
Default style, then follows on next line "Huh?" in the style "Alternate", and
on the third line the style is reset to "Default" for the "Who are you?"
text.
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Set position" id="\pos"}\pos(<i>&lt;X&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;Y&gt;</i>){:/}
Set the position of the line. The _X_ and _Y_ coordinates must be integers and
are given in the script resolution coordinate system. The meaning of _X_ and
_Y_ changes slightly depending on [[alignment|ASS_Tags#linealignment]].

The alignment of the subtitle line is used as anchor point for the position.
I.e. when you have a line with alignment top-left, the top-left corner of the
subtitle is placed at the coordinates given to `\pos`, and for bottom-center
alignment, the bottom center of the subtitle is placed at the coordinates
given.

{::template name="examplebox"}
The following screenshots illustrate the way alignment affects positioning.
The green cross marks the point (320,240) on the video.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Movement" id="\move"}
\move(<i>&lt;x1</i>&gt;,<i>&lt;y1</i>&gt;,<i>&lt;x2</i>&gt;,<i>&lt;y2</i>&gt;)  
\move(<i>&lt;x1</i>&gt;,<i>&lt;y1</i>&gt;,<i>&lt;x2</i>&gt;,<i>&lt;y2</i>&gt;,<i>&lt;t1</i>&gt;,<i>&lt;t2</i>&gt;)
{:/}
The `\move` tag works similar to [[`\pos`|ASS_Tags#setposition]] in that it
positions the subtitle line, the difference is that `\move` makes the subtitle
move.

The two versions of `\move` differ in that one makes the movement occur over
the entire duration of the subtitle, while on the other you specify the time
over which the movement occurs.

The coordinates _x1_, _y1_, _x2_ and _y2_ are given in the script resolution
coordinate system, like `\pos`. The subtitle starts out at point (_x1_,_y1_)
and moves with constant speed so it ends up at (_x2_,_y2_).
[[Alignment|ASS_Tags#linealignment]] influences movement coordinates the same
way as it influences `\pos` coordinates.

In the second version, the times _t1_ and _t2_ are given in milliseconds, ie.
one thousandth of a second, and are relative to the start time of the
subtitle. For example, a _t1_ value of 1500 means that the movement begins 1.5
seconds (one and a half second) after the line has appeared on screen. When
you specify times for the movement, the position of the subtitle is as
follows:

1. Before _t1_, the subtitle is stationary at point (_x1_,_y1_).
1. Between _t1_ and _t2_, the subtitle moves with constant speed from (_x1_,_y1_) to (_x2_,_y2_).
1. After _t2_ the subtitle is stationary at point (_x2_,_y2_).

Note that it is legal to have _t1_ and _t2_ specify times greater than the
duration of the line, but it might not be very useful to do so. Specifying
both _t1_ and _t2_ as 0 (zero) is the same as using the first version of
`\move`, ie. the movement will occur from the start time of the line to the
end time of the line.

There are some things **`\move` can not do**:

* Non-constant-speed movement is not possible. The movement can not, for
  example, start out slow and end fast.
* There can only be one positioning or movement tag in a line. Putting both a
  `\pos` and a `\move` tag in a line will not work. It will also not work to
  put two or more `\move` tags in a single line.

If you need to do do any of those two you will need to split the movement into
segments that are done on separate subtitle lines. (How to do this is outside
the scope of this page.)

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\move(100,150,300,350)</pre>

When the line appears on screen, the subtitle is at (100,150). While the
subtitle is displayed, it moves at constant speed such that it will arrive at
point (300,350) at the same time it disappears.
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\move(100,150,300,350,500,1500)</pre>

The line appears at (100,150). After the line has been displayed for half a
second (500 milliseconds) it begins moving towards (300,350) such that it will
arrive at the point a second and a half (1500 milliseconds) after the line
first appeared on screen.
{:/}

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Rotation origin" id="\org"}\org(<i>&lt;X&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;Y&gt;</i>){:/}
Set the origin point used for [[rotation|ASS_Tags#textrotation]]. This
affects all rotations of the line. The _X_ and _Y_ coordinates are given in
integer script resolution pixels.

When there is no `\org` tag in a line, the rotation origin is implicitly the
same as the [[position anchor point|ASS_Tags#setposition]]. This means that
the rotation origin will move if the line moves and there is no origin set
with `\org`. Note that you can _not_ animate the `\org` tag, you are limited
to a fixed origin if you use it.

If the rotation origin is placed on the vanishing point in a 3D scene, 3D
rotations of subtitle line will produce the correct perspective to match the
scene.

It's perfectly possible (and occasionally useful) to place the origin point
far outside the actual image; if it is sufficiently far away, doing
appropriately calculated small rotations will seem to move the text along a
straight (or almost straight) line through the image. This is somewhat hard to
control, but can be used to work around format limitations with \move, such as
the inability to do accelerated moves or several moves per line.

There can be at most one `\org` tag in a single line, if you put more than one
in a single line, only the first is used.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\org(320,240)</pre>

Fix the rotation origin at point (320,240).
{:/}
{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\org(10000,0)</pre>

Placing the rotation origin at a far away point allows you to use slight
`\frz` rotations to produce "jumping" effects; the text will move up or down
without seeming to rotate.

{::template name="tag_def_box" title="Fade" id="\fad"}\fad(<i>&lt;fadein&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;fadeout&gt;</i>){:/}
Produce a fade-in and fade-out effect. The _fadein_ and _fadeout_ times are
given in milliseconds, ie. 1000 means one second. You can specify _fadein_ or
_fadeout_ as 0 (zero) to not have any fade effect on that end.

Adding a fade effect does not extend the duration of the line, rather the
start or end of the line's display time is used for the fade effect. For this
reason, you should be careful that _fadein_+_fadeout_ is not greater than the
duration of the line. For example, for a line displayed for 4 seconds, the sum
of _fadein_+_fadeout_ should not be greater than 4000.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fad(1200,250)</pre>

Fade in the line in the first 1.2 seconds it is to be displayed, and fade it
out for the last one quarter second it is displayed.

Perform a five-part fade using three alpha values _a1_, _a2_ and _a3_ and four
times _t1_, _t2_, _t3_ and _t4_.

The alpha values are given in _decimal_ and are between 0 and 255, with 0
being fully visible and 255 being invisible. The time values are given in
milliseconds after the start of the line. All seven parameters are required.
(For most common fade effects the `[[\fad|ASS_Tags#fade]]` tag works fine.)

* Before _t1_, the line has alpha _a1_.
* Between _t1_ and _t2_ the line fades from alpha _a1_ to alpha _a2_.
* Between _t2_ and _t3_ the line has alpha _a2_ constantly.
* Between _t3_ and _t4_ the line fades from alpha _a2_ to alpha _a3_.
* After _t4_ the line has alpha _a3_.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\fade(255,32,224,0,500,2000,2200)</pre>

Starts invisible, fades to almost totally opaque, then fades to almost totally
invisible. First fade starts when the line starts and lasts 500 milliseconds.
Second fade starts 1500 milliseconds later, and lasts 200 milliseconds.

Perform a gradual, animated transformation from one style to another. The

a limited set of the override tags are animateable with `\t`:

_Note: For `\clip` and `\iclip`, only the rectangle versions can be animated. The
vector drawing versions cannot be animated._

_Note: Mixing `\clip` and `\iclip` in `\t` tags has undesireable results._

The _t1_ and _t2_ parameters specify the time interval to perform the
transformation over. In the versions without _t1_ and _t2_ the transformation
is performed over the entire duration of the line. The times are given in
milliseconds and are relative to the start time of the line. (For the rest of
the description of `\t`, _t1_ and _t2_ are assumed to be specified, or
implicitly be respectively 0 and the duration of the line.)

The _accel_ parameter can be used to make the animation non-linear and instead
follow an exponential curve. An _accel_ parameter of 1 (one) causes the
animation speed to be linear. A value bewteen 0 and 1 causes the animation to
start fast and end slow. A value greater than 1 causes the animation to start
slow and end fast. (For the mathematically inclined, the function is _y_ = _x_
with _x_ ∈ [0;1] = (_t_-_t1_)/(_t2_-_t1_), _t_ being the current time.)

Before _t1_, the style is as all tags before the `\t` tag specify. After _t2_
the style is as all tags before the `\t` tag, and further overridden by the
given _style overrides_. Between _t1_ and _t2_ the style is gradually animated
between those two points, following the acceleration function described above.

{::template name="examplebox"}

Define a rectangle to clip the line, only the part of the line that is inside
the rectangle is visible. The `\iclip` tag has the opposite effect, it defines
a rectangle where the line is not shown.

The _x1_, _y1_, _x2_ and _y2_ coordinates are given in script resolution
pixels and are relative to the top-left corner of the video. The coordinates
must be integers, there is no possibility to use non-integer coordinates.
(Increasing the script resolution will not increase the precision, the
clipping always happens on video pixel boundaries.)

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\clip(0,0,320,240)</pre>

Assuming 640x480 script resolution, only the part of the line within the top
left quadrant is visible.

\iclip(<i>&lt;scale&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;drawing commands&gt;</i>)
{:/}
Use the shape defined by a vector drawing to selectively display (`\clip`) or
hide (`\iclip`) parts of the line.

The _drawing commands_ are drawing commands as those used with the `\p` tag,
the coordinates are given in script resolution pixels and are relative to the
top left corner of the video.

If the _scale_ is not specified it is assumed to be 1 (one), meaning that
coordinates correspond directly to pixels. The _scale_ works the same way as
the _scale_ for `\p` drawings.

Unlike the rectangular clip, the vector drawing clip can _not_ be animated
with `\t`. If you need to animate a vector drawing clip, you must create
multiple similar subtitle lines with each their own "frame" of the clipping
animation.

{::template name="examplebox"}
<pre>\clip(1,m 50 0 b 100 0 100 100 50 100 b 0 100 0 0 50 0)</pre>

Only show the portion of the line within the defined pseudo-circle.

## Drawing tags ##

Advanced Substation Alpha also supports some advanced drawing tags that allow
you to draw with vectorial graphics. Certain familiarity with vectors and
splines will make the understanding of this much simpler.

### \p<0/1/..> - Toggle drawing mode ###

Setting this tag to 1 or above enables drawing mode. Text after this override
block will then be interpreted as drawing instructions, and not as actually
visible text. Setting this to zero disables drawing mode, restoring normal
behavior. When turning on, the value might be any integer larger than zero,
and will be interpreted as the scale, in 2^(value-1) mode. This is done to
allow sub-pixel accuracy.
e.g.:

    \p1

(Enables drawing with normal coordinates)

    \p0

(Disables drawing)

    \p2

(Enables drawing, and resolution is doubled. So drawing to 200,200 will
actually draw to 100,100)

    \p4

(Enables drawing, and resolution is 8x larger (2^(4-1)). So drawing to 400,400
will actually draw to 50,50)


### \pbo<y> - Baseline offset ###

Defines baseline offset for drawing. This is basically an Y offset to all
coordinates.
e.g.:

    \pbo-50

(Draws everything 50 pixels above specified)

    \pbo100

(Draws everything 100 pixels below specified)


## Drawing commands ##

These commands should appear either in a \clip tag (vectorial overload) or
between \p# and \p0, outside override blocks.  For example (taken straight
from the ASS specs):

* Square:

    {\p1}m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100{\p0}

* Rounded square:

    {\p1}m 0 0 s 100 0 100 100 0 100 c{\p0}

    (c equals to "p 0 0 100 0 100 100" in this case)

* Circle (almost):

    {\p1}m 50 0 b 100 0 100 100 50 100 b 0 100 0 0 50 0{\p0}

    (note that the 2nd 'b' is optional here)

Drawing commands use the primary color for fill and outline color for borders.
They also display shadow. The idea of drawing vectors is that there is an
invisible "cursor" (think of it as the mouse pointer in a drawing program, or
as a pen moving through the image) on the video frame, and you tell it to move
to other positions. As it moves, it draws on the area behind it, and when you
close the line formed, it fills it with the primary color.

### m &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; - Move ###

Moves the cursor to x,y. If you have an unclosed shape, it will automatically
be closed, as the program assumes that you are now drawing a new, independent
shape. All drawing routines must start with this command.

### n &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; - Move (no closing) ###

Moves the cursor to x,y, without closing the current shape.

### l &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; - Line ###

Draws a line from the current cursor position to x,y, and moves the cursor
there afterwards.

### b &lt;x1&gt; &lt;y1&gt; &lt;x2&gt; &lt;y2&gt; &lt;x3&gt; &lt;y3&gt; - Cubic Bézier curve ###

Draws a cubic (3rd degree) Bézier curve from the cursor position to (x3,y3),
using (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) as the control points. Check the [article on
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) for more
information about Bézier curves. In this picture taken from that article, P0
is the cursor position, P1 is x1,y1, P2 is x2,y2 and P3 is x3,y3:  
[[img/Bezier.png]]  
Note that the curve begins at P0, heads towards P1, then arrives at P3 coming
from P2's direction.


### s &lt;x1&gt; &lt;y1&gt; &lt;x2&gt; &lt;y2&gt; &lt;x3&gt; &lt;y3&gt; .. &lt;xN&gt; &lt;yN&gt; - Cubic b-spline ###

Draws a cubic (3rd degree) uniform b-spline to point N. This must contain at
least 3 coordinates (and is, in that case, the same as b). This basically lets
you chain several cubic Bézier curves together. Check this other article on
Wikipedia for more information.

### p &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; - Extend b-spline ###

Extends the b-spline to x,y. This is essentially the same as adding another
pair of coordinates at the end of s.

### c - Close b-spline ###

Closes the b-spline.

_Note: The [[vector clip visual typesetting
tool|Visual_Typesetting#vectorial-clip]] only supports the m, l and b
commands, and may corrupt drawings which use the other commands._
