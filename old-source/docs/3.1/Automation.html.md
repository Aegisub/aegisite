The name **Automation** covers the entire scripting functionality of Aegisub.

## About Automation
The single purpose of Automation is — as the name implies — to automate various aspects of subtitle creation and editing.
This was originally used mainly for creating [[karaoke effects|Glossary/Karaoke_effect]], but over time it has expanded in scope to support more general purpose [[macros|Glossary/Macro]] which add arbitrary new functionaly to Aegisub.

Some of the goals of Automation:

* Macros to automate complex subtitle editing tasks
* Export filters to generate complex effects from simpler input
  * Karaoke effects
  * Translation note boxes
* Probably several yet-undiscovered uses

## Using Automation
Aegisub comes with several Automation scripts already packaged and ready to use.
This includes the advanced **[[Karaoke_Templater]]** script and a **[[collection of macros|Included_macros]]** to simplify some editing tasks.

Aegisub almost always has several Automation scripts loaded at a time.
You can see what scripts are loaded, and load/unload more from the **[[Automation/Manager]]** window.

All Automation scripts also present themselves in Aegisub in one way or another.
Some appear as [[macros in the Automation menu|Running_macros]] and others appear as [[filters in the Export dialog|Exporting]].
Some scripts even appear in both places.

## Automation for programmers  ##
Automation supports scripts in [Lua 5.1](http://www.lua.org) and [MoonScript](http://www.moonscript.org).
Other languages used to be supported, but no one used them.

There are several example scripts included with Aegisub to give you a head start on writing your own ones.
A word of warning: Unless you are an experienced programmer the _kara-templater.lua_ script is a very bad place to start!
